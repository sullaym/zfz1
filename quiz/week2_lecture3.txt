Big Data Tools
(1/1 point)
Why is using traditional analysis tools for big data a poor choice?
1) Storage is becoming less expensive. 
2) The time to read from a 1 TB drive is 3
hours. 
3) Big data does not fit on a single machine. Big data does not fit on a
single machine. - correct 
4) CPUs are getting faster and faster every year.

Using Divide and Conquer
(1/1 point)
What are some of the challenges of using divide and conquer:
1) Moving data is very expensive, - correct
2) Using a single machine is faster than multiple machines
3) Having many machines means having to deal with many failures, - correct
4) Having many machines means having to deal with slow machines, - correct
5) Using hash tables for very large documents works well

Map Reduce
(1/1 point)
Which of the following problems does a MapReduce implementation handle?
