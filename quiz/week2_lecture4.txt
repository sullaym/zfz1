Resilient Distributed Datasets
(1/1 point)
Which of the following is not a property of RDDs?
1) They can be changed after they are constructed, - correct 
2) They can be created by transformations applied to existing RDDs 
3) They enable parallel operations on collections of distributed data 
4) They track lineage information to enable efficient recomputation of lost data

Spark Transformations
(1/1 point)
Which of the following are properties of Spark transformations?
1) They are not computed right away, - correct
2) They are computed right away, - correct
3) They are vulnerable to machine failures
4) They are like a recipe for creating a result

Spark Actions
(1/1 point)
Which of the following is not a property of Spark Actions?
1) They cause Spark to execute the recipe to transform the source data
2) They are the primary mechanism for getting results out of Spark
3) They are lazily evaluated They are lazily evaluated, - correct
4) The results are returned to the driver

Spark Program Lifecycle
(1/1 point)
Which of the following are part of a Spark program's lifecycle?
1) RDDs that are reused may be cached, - correct
2) Transformations cause parallel computation to be immediately executed
3) Actions cause parallel computation to be immediately executed, - correct
4) Transformations lazily create new RDDs, - correct
5) Actions create recipes for peforming parallel computation on datasets

pySpark Shared Variables
(2/2 points)
In iterative or repeated computations, broadcast variables avoid the problem
of repeatedly sending the same data to workers:
1) False
2) True, - correct

Accumulators can be used by Spark workers to efficiently read values during distributed computations:
1) False, - correct
2) True
